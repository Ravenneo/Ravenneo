## Who am I?

Hi, I'm José “JJ” Gallego. I lead Hardware Technical Operations at Qamarero, where I work on reliable, remotely managed hardware for hospitality and logistics. On the side, I do freelance security work and keep breaking/fixing things in my homelab.

Originally, I came from science: I hold a Ph.D. in Microbial Molecular Biology from Newcastle University and worked on membrane protein purification at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. These days I apply the same experimental mindset to networks, hardware and security instead of bacteria and proteins.

## 🔭 What I'm currently working on

- 🛰️ **Mesh and LoRa**: MeshTastic nodes, ESP32/LoRa hardware and gateways for low-power, long-range sensing.
- 🧾 **Hospitality & logistics hardware**: OpenWrt routers, printers, POS integrations and remote fleet management.
- 🛡️ **Security & homelab**: IDS/IPS, VPNs, small-business/homelab monitoring and hardening.
- 🧠 **AI & agents**: LLM-based troubleshooting playbooks, simple agents for operations and observability.
- 🧪 Side experiments: small tools/scripts for device management, OS automations and data collection.


## 🌱 What I'm learning

- 📡 MeshTastic internals, LoRa / LoRaWAN and low-power wireless design.
- 🔍 IDS / NIDS and log analysis (Suricata/Zeek/Wazuh-style workflows).
- 🕵️ OSINT and attack-surface mapping for small orgs and homelabs.
- 🐍 Python for automation and tooling.
- ⚙️ Rust when I need something safer/faster than a quick script.
- 🤖 Agentic frameworks and better prompt design for hands-on ops tasks.
